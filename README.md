## Final Project: Automated Wine Recommendation

### Project Overview:
This project focuses on creating an automated wine recommendation system to address challenges faced by consumers in selecting wines. The project was conducted by a group of students to explore data-driven methods for improving wine recommendations based on consumer reviews and sentiment analysis.

### Background and Motivation:
The wine market has experienced various challenges, such as high harvests, trade conflicts, the COVID-19 pandemic, and shifts in consumer spending habits. These factors have impacted the market, making it crucial for businesses to understand consumer preferences better and provide more personalized recommendations to enhance customer satisfaction and sales.

### Data Collection:
The dataset used in this project was sourced from Wine Enthusiast, comprising approximately 130,000 unique wine samples, predominantly focused on the US market. The dataset includes variables such as price, country, province, designation, region, points (ratings), description, and taster_name.

### Analytical Techniques:
Several analytical techniques were employed in this project to achieve the desired outcomes:
- Binary Sentiment Analysis: To understand the sentiment of reviews for top-rated wines and analyze customer feedback.
- Mclust Method: A clustering technique used to group data with similar characteristics, aiding in understanding the variety distributions.
- Regression Models: Employed to predict relationships between variables.
- Decision Tree: A classification technique to predict wine variety.
- Recommendation Systems: Both user-based and item-based collaborative filtering methods were utilized to provide personalized wine recommendations.

### Key Findings:
- Sentiment Analysis: There was no clear evidence showing that wines with higher score-points had a higher proportion of positive words in reviewers' descriptions. However, a higher sentiment score generally correlated with higher ratings.
- Regression Model: Identified 21 words that have significant relationships with wine varieties.
- Collaborative Filtering: User-based collaborative filtering (UBCF) and item-based collaborative filtering (IBCF) were compared. UBCF and IBCF produced different results, highlighting the importance of using both methods for comprehensive recommendations.

### Results and Conclusion:
The sentiment analysis showed that sentiment scores correlate with wine ratings, although not strongly.
The collaborative filtering methods provided varied recommendations, suggesting the need to consider multiple approaches for better accuracy.
It was recommended to use both UBCF and IBCF methods in tandem to provide users with a broader range of suitable wine options based on their preferences.

### Conclusion:
This project showcased the effectiveness of combining sentiment analysis and collaborative filtering to develop an automated wine recommendation system. The insights gained can help businesses understand consumer preferences better and provide more personalized recommendations, ultimately enhancing customer satisfaction and driving sales in the competitive wine market.
